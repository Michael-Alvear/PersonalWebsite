                    <p>P.C. is a program that can classify text into different post/title categories based on pre-trained data. It has the ability to take any training data, use that data, and from then on classify any test post into categories. This has multiple use cases in the real world, such as delegating/grouping ticket for I.T support, leading to a more efficient Testing.</p>

                    <p>L.C.P is a program that uses labeled data from a real database to predict what factors make a person more likely to take a personal loan. Using a Logistic Regression ML model, we're able classify data, rank data, and predict whether a person with certain characteristics would take out a loan. World world applications include banks and brokerages advertising to a particular group of people based on my ML model.</p>

                    <p>This was a project I developed in EECS 497 in collaboration with a fantastic team using Flask. The AI would ask simple questions eg location traveling to, price range, ect and would integrate web scraping with OpenAI API to create a travel itinerary that would fit the requirements. </p>

                    <p>The Mindful Gathering was a mental awareness event hosted on the Diag at the University of Michigan. The event focused on student mental health near finals season that partnered with many student organizations and even therapy dogs to provide students with the support that many can't get elsewhere.</p>
